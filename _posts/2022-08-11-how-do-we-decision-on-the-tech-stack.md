It always happens that we need to decide on the tech stack is best for new projects, or legacy system modernization, usually within limited time. There are quite a lot aspects to consider. Listing some key ones here as a reminder, in case we might consider only one or two aspects like popularity of the tech stack.

#### Service need.
> * Features we need can be fulfilled by it?
> * Any special need on performance? eg. redis vs mysql

#### Maturity with solid ecosystem, ease of development
> * Enough documentation and learning materials
> * Availability of tools, and IDEs for the selected Framework to enhance developer productivity.
> * Frameworks provide code modules and interfaces with built-in design patterns that remove the coding complexity from application developers
> * Framework support for automating the tasks related to building and deploy of microservices

#### Popularity & Community Support
> * How is the industry acceptance for the tech stack? How many people and companies using it? The more popular the more available developers to join the team.
> * Community support is usually matured for the project outsourced under big companies like Apache, Google, Spring, etc. So selecting a framework should also take these into consideration

#### Compatibility
> * Is it compatible with others in the tech stack?

#### Skillset of the team
> * Does the tech stack match the skillset of the team, if not, is the team willing to switch to it? How is the learning curve required?

#### Cost
> * Opensource or commercial?
> * Effort to migrate to the new tech stack?

#### Security
> * Especially for open source ones, any risk of data leak?

#### Build vs buy
> * Any commercial product can be used to fulfill the requirement instead of select tech stack to build?
